Due to sampling methodology, margins of error exist for all reported survey estimates. For Wellbeing data, the maximum margin of error applies when the observed percentage is 50%. The margin of error shrinks as the percentage approaches the extremes of 0% or 100%. The maximum margin of error has a 95% confidence interval. See http://ctdatahaven.org/reports/datahaven-community-wellbeing-survey for more information on the survey methodology. For all other data, margins of error represent the 90% confidence interval for estimates. With 90% confidence, each estimate falls between a lower limit (subtracting margin of error from estimate) and an upper limit (adding margin of error to estimate).

Due to sampling methodology, margins of error exist for all reported survey estimates. For Wellbeing data, the maximum margin of error applies when the observed percentage is 50%. The margin of error shrinks as the percentage approaches the extremes of 0% or 100%. The maximum margin of error has a 95% confidence interval. See http://ctdatahaven.org/reports/datahaven-community-wellbeing-survey for more information on the survey methodology. For all other data, margins of error represent the 90% confidence interval for estimates. With 90% confidence, each estimate falls between a lower limit (subtracting margin of error from estimate) and an upper limit (adding margin of error to estimate).
